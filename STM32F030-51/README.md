# REMCU examples for STM32F030 and STM32F051 board

![raspberry remcu stm32f030](img/rasp_f030.png)

## Overview

These simple examples demonstrate how to easily expand hardware of a Raspberry Pi board using 50 cent STM32F030 microcontroller(and other low-cost STM32F0 MCUs) and some wires.  
The Python scripts ran Raspberry will gain access to internal STM32F0 peripheral modules like DAC, ADC, DMA, GPIO and others as if these peripherals were a part of Raspberry chip. Without a microcontroller firmware development and a kernel driver just with help [**REMCU Library**](https://remotemcu.github.io/).

There are also [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) scripts for running on PC(MacOS, Linux, Windows)

To interact with a microcontroller hardware from our PC and Raspberry Pi we use the driver functions of [Standard Peripheral Library for STM32F0 line](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm32048.html) of STMicroelectronics company. It is a vendor software development kit provided by STMicroelectronics company for a firmware development of STM32 MCU.
Our application calls these driver functions, just like calls them for hardware operations from firmware code. The REMCU Library translates a local driver function call on the PC or embedded computer to a remote call of the same​ driver function on the STM32F0 chip using debug interface.

The code controlling MCU peripheral module have been taken from  [example](STM32F0_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0/Project/STM32F0_StdPeriph_Examples) of [Standard Peripheral Library for STM32F0](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm32048.html)

</details>

Navigate to ‘examples_stm32f030’ or ‘examples_stm32f051’ directory depending on your board.

#### Manual configuration. Installation all necessary components. For 32-bit Raspbian System
That requires next:  
1. Downlaod prebuild OpenOCD from [here](https://github.com/remotemcu/Raspbian_packages) to your Raspbian RootFS. The build have been tested on Raspberry Pi and we recommend it.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remotemcu/Raspbian_packages.git
```

Connect this Raspberry's GPIO pins to debug port of the MCU using scheme above and run the OpenOCD script:

```bash
cd Raspbian_packages/
./openocd_stm32f0x.sh
```

Another way you can install OpenOCD(version 0.10 or higher) from Raspbian's repo:  

```bash
sudo apt-get install openocd
```
In this case, run OpenOCD utility this way:
* For Raspberry 1, use this scheme [stm32f030](img/scheme-30_2_3_4.png), [stm32f051](img/scheme-51_2_3_4.png) (SWDIO -> GPIO25 and SWCLK -> GPIO11) and run OpenOCD with the arguments below:
```bash
sudo openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-native.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/stm32f0x.cfg
```
* For Raspberry 2 or 3:
```bash
sudo openocd -f interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/stm32f0x.cfg
```
* For Raspberry 4, please use sysfsgpio interface:
```bash
sudo openocd -f interface/sysfsgpio-raspberrypi.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/stm32f0x.cfg
```
or try to use our [prebuilt OpenOCD package](https://github.com/remotemcu/Raspbian_packages) with the **openocd_stm32f0x.sh** script

>More information about Rpi connection with MCU using OpenOCD can be found here:
https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-microcontrollers-using-openocd-on-raspberry-pi
or
https://iosoft.blog/2019/01/28/raspberry-pi-openocd/

2. Download these examples to Raspberry RootFS and go to STM32F030-51 directory  

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/remotemcu/remcu_examples/
 cd STM32F030-51/
```

3. Download the necessary version of REMCU Lib from [**repo**](https://github.com/remotemcu/prebuilt_libraries/tree/master/STM32/STM32F0/): [STM32F030](https://github.com/remotemcu/prebuilt_libraries/tree/master/STM32/STM32F0/STM32F030-StdPeriph_Lib-V1.5.0-01)/[STM32F051](https://github.com/remotemcu/prebuilt_libraries/tree/master/STM32/STM32F0/STM32F051-StdPeriph_Lib-V1.5.0-01) or build the library yourself using [the sdk collection repo ](https://github.com/remotemcu/remcu-chip-sdks)  


4. Copy the lib files and *remcu_include* folder to the example folder  

```bash
$pwd 
.../STM32F030-51/
```


### Python scripts

You can use the ReMCU library not only in the C/C++ program on the Raspberry Pi board. Alternatively, you can call ReMCU library functions using other programming languages. As Python is an official recommended programming language of Raspberry, let’s see some Python examples. To make working with them less troublesome, we provide language wrappers(**STM32F030_StdPeriph_Lib.py** and **STM32F051_StdPeriph_Lib.py** in the REMCU archive).
 With these wrappers it becomes easy to work with hardware as it is using C or C++.

  * [**PA4_pin_toogle.py**](PA4_pin_toogle.py) and [**PC13_pin_toogle.py**](PC13_pin_toogle.py) script toggles the PA4 and PC13 MCU pin accordingly. The code of the sample have been taken from **GPIO_IOToggle** ([main.c](STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Examples/GPIO/GPIO_IOToggle/main.c)) example of [Standard Peripheral Library(SPL) for STM32F0x line](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm32048.html) Just execute it:  
  
```bash
python PA4_pin_toogle.py
```

```bash
python PC13_pin_toogle.py
```

![led](img/led-crop.gif)  

A small script [**adc_line.py**](adc_line.py) receives the ADC data and builds a horizontal bar chart  based on this value. Plug a variable resistor into the PA5 pin and run the application. The code of the sample is based on **ADC_BasicExample** ([main.c](STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Examples/ADC/ADC_BasicExample/main.c)) example of [Standard Peripheral Library(SPL) for STM32F0x line](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm32048.html)  
Rotate the shaft and you will get the voltage versus time chart.  
![adc_line](img/adc_console.gif)  

> Note that we didn’t develop the MCU firmware. Our Linux program directly works with ADC and GPIO modules using a remote procedure execution of the Standard Peripheral Library. In more detail in [video](https://youtu.be/JdBabbC5Prk)   


The REMCU library can be ported to any version of the Raspberry Pi board and also on far less powerful and much more powerful embedded platforms

#### Running...
There are the same programs and python scripts as above in the Raspberry part. You can see their description there.

#### Jupyter Notebook
If you ever wish to conduct a quick experiment with any chip peripheral module or explore it, then REMCU is the right tool for that. It can be easily integrated in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with an Interactive [C++ interpreter](https://github.com/root-project/cling) . This IDE is free and it lets you run and execute C or C++ code on the go. This way you can call the functions of a driver directly and control MCU or SoC in real time.  
It saves a lot of time that is usually spent on the development of experimental MCU firmware. An interact work with MCU/SoC peripherals helps us to explore new peripheral blocks of MCU/SoC quicker.  
And furthermore, the application code written in the C programming language using REMCU is backwards-portable, meaning it can be transferred from a desktop program to the MCU program and vice-versa. The code will work just as fine on MCU as it works on PC. That's why code written on desktop with ReMCU can be used to develop stand-alone firmware for MCU.  

[**REMCU tutorial**](https://youtu.be/iuofdoWWkC4) can help you run these notebooks.

 * **Cpp_Examples.ipynb** is a C++ script for Jupyter Notebook.  

Install [**Anaconda Distribution**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Run Anaconda Navigator and install [**xeus-cling**](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) and [**xplot**](https://github.com/QuantStack/xplot) packages.

## 3. Windows
Unfortunately, C++ [Cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling) interpreter is only available for Unix-like system (***MacOS*** and ***Linux***).  
But there is possible to use the REMCU with high level languages like Python, Java, C# and others.

***Python_Examples.ipynb*** sample demonstrates work with REMCU lib in Windows using Python interpreter.
