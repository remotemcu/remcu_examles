# REMCU examples for STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill board

![title](img/title.png)

## Overview

These simple examples demonstrate how to easily expand hardware of a Raspberry Pi board using one dollar STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller and some wires.  
The C++ applications and Python scripts ran Raspberry will gain access to internal STM32F103 peripheral modules like DAC, ADC, DMA, GPIO and others as if these peripherals were a part of Raspberry chip. Without a microcontroller firmware development and a kernel driver just with help [**REMCU Library**](https://remotemcu.com/).

There are also [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) scripts for running on PC(MacOS, Linux, Windows)

To interact with a microcontroller hardware from our PC we use the driver functions of [Standard Peripheral Library for STM32F10x line](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32-standard-peripheral-libraries/stsw-stm32054.html) of STMicroelectronics company. It is a vendor software development kit provided by STMicroelectronics company for a firmware development of STM32F103C8T6 MCU.
Our application calls these driver functions, just like calls them for hardware operations from firmware code.

The code controlling MCU peripheral module have been taken from  [example](STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0/Project/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Examples) of [Standard Peripheral Library for STM32F10X](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32-standard-peripheral-libraries/stsw-stm32054.html)

#### Manual configuration. Installation all necessary components. For 32-bit Raspbian System
That requires next:  
1. Downlaod prebuild OpenOCD from [here](https://github.com/remotemcu/Raspbian_packages) to your Raspbian RootFS. The build have been tested on Raspberry Pi and we recommend it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remotemcu/Raspbian_packages.git
```

Connect this Raspberry's GPIO pins to debug port of the MCU using scheme above [1](img/scheme.png), [2/3/4](img/scheme_2_3_4.png) and run the OpenOCD script:

```bash
cd Raspbian_packages/
./openocd.sh
```

Another way you can install OpenOCD(version 0.10 or higher) from Raspbian's repo:  

```bash
sudo apt-get install openocd
```

In this case, run OpenOCD utility this way:  


* For Raspberry 1, use [this scheme](img/scheme_2_3_4.png) (SWDIO -> GPIO25 and SWCLK -> GPIO11) and run OpenOCD with the arguments below:
```bash
sudo openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-native.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/stm32f1x.cfg
```
* For Raspberry 2 or 3:
```bash
sudo openocd -f interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/stm32f1x.cfg
```
* For Raspberry 4, please use sysfsgpio interface:
```bash
sudo openocd -f interface/sysfsgpio-raspberrypi.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/stm32f1x.cfg
```
or try to use our [prebuilt OpenOCD package](https://github.com/remotemcu/Raspbian_packages) with the **openocd.sh** script

>More information about Rpi connection with MCU using OpenOCD can be found here:
https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-microcontrollers-using-openocd-on-raspberry-pi
or
https://iosoft.blog/2019/01/28/raspberry-pi-openocd/

2. Download these examples to Raspberry RootFS and go to STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill directory

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/remotemcu/remcu_examples/
 cd STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill/
```

3. Download the necessary version of REMCU Lib from [**repo**](https://github.com/remotemcu/prebuilt_libraries/tree/master/STM32/STM32F10/STM32F10X_MD-StdPeriph_Lib-V3.5.0-01/Raspbian_armv6) or build the library yourself using [the sdk collection repo ](https://github.com/remotemcu/remcu-chip-sdks)  

4. Copy the lib files and *remcu_include* folder to this folder. 

```bash
$pwd 
..../STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill/
```


### C++ programs

1. A small application ***ADC_line*** receives the ADC data and builds a horizontal bar chart  based on this value. Plug a variable resistor into the PA4 pin and run the application.

2. There are two examples to work with CAN bus, ***CAN_send*** and ***CAN_receiver*** programs. These examples work on 125 kBps. For other baud rates and this clock configuration(see system_stm32f10x.c), the CAN Initialization code (Prescaler value) should be amended accordingly:  
```cpp
  //CAN_InitStructure.CAN_Prescaler = 4*16; //Prescaler for 62.5 kBps
  CAN_InitStructure.CAN_Prescaler = 4*8; //Prescaler for 125 kBps
  //CAN_InitStructure.CAN_Prescaler = 4*4; //Prescaler for 250 kBps
  //CAN_InitStructure.CAN_Prescaler = 4*2; //Prescaler for 500 kBps
  //CAN_InitStructure.CAN_Prescaler = 4*1; //Prescaler for 1 MBps
```
Build CAN network like this:

### Python scripts

You can use the ReMCU library not only in the C/C++ program on the Raspberry Pi board. Alternatively, you can call ReMCU library functions using other programming languages. As Python is an official recommended programming language of Raspberry, let’s see some Python examples. To make working with them less troublesome, we provide language wrappers(**STM32F10X_MD_StdPeriph_Lib.py**).
 With these wrappers it becomes easy to work with hardware as it is using C or C++.

#### Running...
There are the same programs and python scripts as above in the Raspberry part. You can see their description there.

#### Jupyter Notebook
If you ever wish to conduct a quick experiment with any chip peripheral module or explore it, then REMCU is the right tool for that. It can be easily integrated in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with an Interactive [C++ interpreter](https://github.com/root-project/cling) . This IDE is free and it lets you run and execute C or C++ code on the go. This way you can call the functions of a driver directly and control MCU or SoC in real time.  
It saves a lot of time that is usually spent on the development of experimental MCU firmware. An interact work with MCU/SoC peripherals helps us to explore new peripheral blocks of MCU/SoC quicker.  
And furthermore, the application code written in the C programming language using REMCU is backwards-portable, meaning it can be transferred from a desktop program to the MCU program and vice-versa. The code will work just as fine on MCU as it works on PC. That's why code written on desktop with ReMCU can be used to develop stand-alone firmware for MCU.  

[**REMCU tutorial**](https://youtu.be/iuofdoWWkC4) can help you run these notebooks.

 * **Cpp_Examples.ipynb** is a C++ script for Jupyter Notebook.  

Install [**Anaconda Distribution**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Run Anaconda Navigator and install [**xeus-cling**](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) and [**xplot**](https://github.com/QuantStack/xplot) packages.

## 3. Windows
Unfortunately, C++ [Cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling) interpreter is only available for Unix-like system (***MacOS*** and ***Linux***).  
But there is possible to use the REMCU with high level languages like Python, Java, C# and others.

***Python_Examples.ipynb*** sample demonstrates work with REMCU lib in Windows using Python interpreter.
