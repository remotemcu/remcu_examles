# Compass example

![title](img/title.png)

## Overview

The **compass** app grabs digital magnetic data from on-board([STM32F3Discovery](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00063382-discovery-kit-with-stm32f303vc-mcu-stmicroelectronics.pdf)) *MEMS LSM303DLHC* E-compass sensor and shows pointer/needle showing the direction of magnetic north in real time.
We didnâ€™t load any specific firmware into the microcontroller. Our program just works directly with the I2C peripheral block of the STM32 MCU using a remote procedure execution of the [Standard Peripheral Library](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32-standard-peripheral-libraries.html) with help [**REMCU Library**](https://remotemcu.com/). In this way, our application can interact with the accelerometer integrated into the discovery board.

It is just like communicating with the sensor with the help of a USB-I2C convertor. In this case, the STM32F303 chip is the USB-I2C converter. But unlike a highly specialized converter, a microcontroller has great potential and rich number of peripherals.

To interact with a microcontroller hardware from our PC we use the driver functions of [STM32F3-Discovery_FW_V1.1.0](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32-standard-peripheral-libraries.html) of STMicroelectronics company. It is a vendor software development kit provided by STMicroelectronics company for a firmware development of STM32 MCU.
Our application calls these driver functions, just like calls them for hardware operations from firmware code.

The code controlling I2C peripheral module have been taken from **MEMS**([main.c](STM32F3-Discovery_FW_V1.1.0/Project/Demonstration/main.c)) example of [Standard Peripheral Library(SPL) for STM32F3Discovery](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32-standard-peripheral-library-expansion/stsw-stm32118.html). You can see description of SPL examples at [UM1565](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00062956-description-of-stm32f37xx38xx-standard-peripheral-library-stmicroelectronics.pdf) doc.

## Installation and Use
### Project prerequirements
To run the example next software is required:

  * PC with MacOS or Linux(Ubuntu recommended) or Windows OS
  * An [STM32F3Discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/STM32F3Discovery.html) board
  * [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
>Note: QT framework is only required to build and run the example. The REMCU lib is a simple dynamic library. It does not depend on the QT frameworks and the QT Creator. You can add the REMCU library to other IDEs and frameworks
  * [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
  * MSVC2015(or later) toolchain or MinGW 7.3(or later) for Windows OS.
  * Debug server. It can be an OpenOCD(**We recommend this [prebuild package](https://github.com/ilg-archived/openocd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-12-20190422)**)
>Other OpenOCD versions can have an incompatibility with this REMCU Library version. For instance, [v0.10.0-13](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/tag/v0.10.0-13) version has another TCL server API and you can not use remcu_connect2OpenOCD function in REMCU Library for connecting to OpenOCD TCL server(default 6666 port). Only remcu_connect2GDB function for connecting OpenOCD GDB server (default 3333 port). or st-link GDB server from [Atollic TrueStudio](https://atollic.com/truestudio/) or [Jlink GDB server](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-link-gdb-server/about-j-link-gdb-server/) (if you use jlink instead of st-link)

### Prepare
Download the example. Download the necessary version of REMCU Lib from [**repo**](https://github.com/remotemcu/prebuilt_libraries/tree/master/STM32/STM32F3/STM32F30X-StdPeriph_Lib-V1.1.0-01) or build the library yourself using [the sdk collection repo ](https://github.com/remotemcu/remcu-chip-sdks) 

Copy the lib files and *remcu_include* folder to this folder.
</details>
fExtract the library to examples the folder (accel_graph folder). Open the **accell_graph** project with help Qt Creator and build it. Run compiled app.

Connect the Discovery board to your PC, then

#### If you want to use OpenOCD

Run OpenOCD with arguments above:

Macos/Linux:
```bash 
openocd.exe -f board/STM32F3Discovery.cfg
```

#### If you want to use st-link GDB server
Install [Atollic TrueStudio](https://atollic.com/truestudio/).
Go to ***TrueSTUDIO for STM32 9.3.0\Servers\ST-LINK_gdbserver*** and run **ST-Link_GDB_server.bat** script

</details>

####  Running the cmpass app
Just run application. It will automatically connect to debug server with IP 127.0.0.1 and port 6666. If you have a non-default openocd configuration or other server change code in [main.cpp](main.cpp#L69) file to connect to the server.
```Cpp
    //If you have non-default openocd configuration or other server you type the port number and IP that be used the server to arguments below
    const bool connect_ok = remcu_connect2OpenOCD("127.0.0.1", 6666, 1);
    //uncomment row below if use OpenOCD GDB server
    //connect_ok = remcu_connect2GDB("127.0.0.1", 3333, 1);
```
